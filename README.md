# **MobileDevelopment_OI_31_SP**

Labs repository for the OI-31SP group of the **Mobile Development Course**.

## **Repository Guidelines**

1. Each participant must create a personal folder in the root directory named after themselves, for example:

   ```
   Ostrovka Dmytro
   ```
2. Create an initial Swift project as the **initial commit**, and copy the repository’s `.gitignore` file into your project folder.
3. Each lab submission must be made as a **new Pull Request (PR)** to the `main` branch.

   * Follow this guide on how to create a pull request:
     [GitHub Docs – Creating a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
4. After the PR has been successfully **reviewed and approved**, it may be **merged** into the `main` branch.

   ```
